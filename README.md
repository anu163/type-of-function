# CustomToken Smart Contract
The CustomToken is a Solidity smart contract that implements a customizable ERC-20 token with additional features. It is based on the OpenZeppelin library and includes functionalities for token creation, minting, transferring, and burning. The contract is designed to be owned by a single entity and provides access control for specific functions.

# Features
ERC-20 Standard Compatibility: The contract inherits from the OpenZeppelin ERC20 implementation, making it fully compatible with the ERC-20 token standard. This means it can be used in various decentralized applications (dApps), exchanges, and wallets that support ERC-20 tokens.

Customizable Token Creation: The contract allows for the creation of a new ERC-20 token with a custom name and symbol. The initial token supply can also be specified during deployment.

Minting: The contract owner has the ability to mint (create) new tokens and allocate them to specified addresses. This can be useful for distributing tokens to various stakeholders or participants.

Transferring Tokens: Token holders can transfer their tokens to other addresses using the standard ERC-20 transfer function. The contract overrides this function to provide customized behavior.

Burning Tokens: Token holders can burn (destroy) a certain amount of their tokens using the burn function. This reduces the total token supply.

Ownership and Access Control: The contract extends the OpenZeppelin Ownable contract, allowing for easy ownership management. Certain functions, such as minting, are restricted to the contract owner only.

# Deployment and Usage
Prerequisites: Ensure you have the required development environment set up, including a compatible Solidity compiler and development tools.

Installation: You need to have the OpenZeppelin contracts library installed. If not, install it using:

bash
Copy code
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
Deployment: Deploy the CustomToken contract with the desired parameters, including the token's name, symbol, and initial supply. This can be done through a deployment script or using a tool like Remix or Truffle.

Interacting with the Contract: After deployment, you can interact with the contract through its functions:

Use the mint function to create and allocate new tokens to specific addresses (only accessible by the contract owner).
Use the standard transfer function to send tokens between addresses.
Use the burn function to destroy a certain amount of tokens from your own balance.
# Security Considerations
Ensure that you understand the implications of the functions you expose and the ownership of the contract. Misuse of the minting function could lead to unintended inflation of the token supply.
Always perform thorough testing and auditing before deploying the contract on a live network.
